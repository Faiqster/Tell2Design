Balcony 1 is located on the east side of the floor plan and approximately 8 ft. wide. This would best be laid out as the master room's private balcony. Balcony 2 is on the west side of the floor plan and approximately 12 ft. wide. This would be best served if it was laid out on the east side instead. Bathroom is decent size. Should have two access points, one from the master and one from the living room. The size is about 10 x 10 feet. This space would be best served as a second bedroom or guest room which would provide more versatility. The kitchen is fairly small and would look like have very little storage for kitchen utensils and cabinetry. One good thing is the open concept so you can be cooking in the kitchen while entertaining guests in the living room, The living area makes up the majority of the square footage. It is approximately 25 x 30 ft in dimension. Provides very open concept and easily see where the other rooms are from any vantage point. The master bedroom is around 15 x 15 feet. It would be good to have a door with direct access to the bathroom without having to leave the bedroom. Since there are two balconies one should be for the master room with direct access.
