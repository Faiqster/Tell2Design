The southern facing balcony 1 is wide and well sized, about 14 feet by 4 feet. It is only accessible through the living room, bordering the entire southern wall of the rectangular section of the living room. The small balcony 2 is at the very northern portion of the floor plan, bordering the northern wall of the kitchen. It is approximately 4 feet by 2 feet. The well sized bathroom is approximately 8 by 4 feet. It is between the two bedrooms, providing separation between the two, but is otherwise conveniently located in the center of the floor plan. About 10 by 12 feet, the common room is located to the top left of the floorplan, above the bathroom and next to the kitchen. Its location makes its private, further away from the rectangular portion of the living room. The small kitchen is only about 5 by 4 feet. It is located on the north of the floor plan, away from the living room and master bedroom. The living room is at times narrow but well sized. It is made up of a large rectangle, approximately 12 by 15 feet, connected to an L shape above it approximately 15 feet by 10 feet, with the upper right corner missing. Albeit an odd shape, the living room provides access to all other rooms of the floor plan while also providing privacy and division between the two bedrooms. The large master is approximately 12 by 15 feet, nearly the same size as the rectangular part of the living room. It located on the south-east of the floor plan, sharing a wall with the living room to its left and the bathroom to its north.
