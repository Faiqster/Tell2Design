The bathroom is south of the entryway and lies on the east side of the hallway. The bathroom is roughly 5x5 feet. The common room is the same size as the master room (10x20 feet), and lies south of the bathroom and also touches against the master room to its west. The eastern edge should be in line with the eastern edge of the bathroom. The living room is at the north end of the house. The room measures about a 20x20 foot square, with about a 3x5 chunk out of the northwest corner. From the southeast corner, about 2 feet in from the east edge, there is a hallway of about 4x5 feet large that extends south. On the east edge, around 2 feet up from the southeast corner is an entryway to the home. The master room lies to the southwest of the living room. It is a 10x20 foot room which is connected to the hallway from the living room.
