The larger balcony 2 is located to the immediate north of the entryway, near common room 1. It is about 12 by 2 feet. The small bathroom is about 4 by 4 feet, and located towards the bottom of the floor plan. Mostly surrounded by the living room, the bathroom is further away from the rest of the floor plan. Nestled between the master room and common room 2, the larger bathroom is approximately 8 feet by 4 feet. The rectangular room is approximately 8 by 12 feet. It is between the living room and the master bedroom, on the northern side of the floor plan. Common room 2 is the smallest room, about 10 by 10 feet. It is located to the most south and west side of the floor plan, near both bathrooms. The large living room is oddly shaped, approximately 20 by 30 feet total, although a narrower shape that gives access to all of the other rooms.

It is behind the common room 1, providing the master room good privacy from the living room.
