The balcony is located in the south most part of the apartment is less than 5 feet in size. It's unknown what kind of view the balcony has and if it gets a lot of sunlight or no sunlight. It seems to be an inconvenient size for a balcony, being quite small. The bathroom is infront of the entrance door and is around 5 feet in length and width. It feels to be in an inconvenient spot since it will take the home owners a moment to reach it at night or when guests come in they're faced with the bathroom upon entering the abode. The common room is about 10 feet in width and 20 in length, this room is specifically what people would call a livingroom where you distribute your couch, coffee table and entertain your guests. It is located south, right before the entrance to the balcony and would be next to what is presumed to be the kitchen? A large area that combines not just a casual corner but also the entrance hall and kitchen area. The living area takes about 70-80% of the apartment (Approx. 40 feet in length) and seems to be the focal point of the entire apartment. It stretches from the entrance all the way to the left of the master suite. This is a north facing apartment building with an entrance that faces the bathroom. The master bedroom is located south of the apartment building and is about 10 feet in width, 20 in length approximately. It is in it's own corner, little further away from the bathroom which is down the hall infront of the entrance.
