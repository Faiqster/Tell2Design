The balcony is at the very bottom of the plan, sharing a wall with the living room (above) and common room 1 (left). It is the smallest area on the plan, at about 15 feet by 5 feet The bathroom is along the left wall of the plan, below common room 2 and above the master room. It is about 5 foot wide and 10 foot long. Common room 1 the bottom of the plan, to the right of the master room and to the left of the living room. It's slightly smaller than the master room, about 11 feet by 10 feet. Common room 2nis at the top of the floor plan, between the kitchen and bathroom. It's about 10 feet wide and 7 foot long. The kitchen is located at the top of the plan, to the left of the living room and right of the second common room. It's about 7 by 8 feet. The living room takes up most of the right wall on the plan. It is by far the largest room in the plan and is above the balcony. The kitchen and common room 1 share a left wall with it, but io connects with every other room. I'd estimate it to be about 15 feet at the bottom, 25 feet along the right side with a slight curve in the wall at the top. It also extends on the left side, giving it an extra 15 feet at its widest point. The master room is in the bottom left of the floor plan. It is below the bathroom and to the left of common room 1. I'd guess it to be about 12 feet by 12 feet.
