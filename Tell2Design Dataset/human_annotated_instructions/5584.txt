Balcony 1 is located on the northern side of the unit.  It is adjacent to the living room and master bedroom. It appears to be 10'x5' SF. Balcony 2 is located on the southeast corner of the unit, adjacent to the kitchen.  It appears to be accessible from the living room. It also appears to be 15'x5' SF. The bathroom is located on the western side of the unit, accessible via the living room, common room, and master bedroom.  It is the smallest room in the house, coming in at approximately 8'x4' SF. The common room is adjacent to the living room and the bathroom. It appears to be slightly less than a 13'x13' due to the bathroom walls taking up space in the northwest corner of the room. The kitchen is located on the eastern side of the unit, with access to the living room and possibly the balcony.  It appears to be 10'x9' SF. The living room is adjacent to all rooms in the house.  It has access to both Balcony 1 and Balcony 2.  The main entry to the unit is located on the eastern wall of the living room.  All rooms are accessible via the living room.  It is the largest room in the house, and while I cannot accurately calculate the square footage, it has several different areas that could be used as different nooks for reading, an office, etc. The master room is located on the western side of the unit, with access to the bathroom, living room and balcony 1.  It appears to be approximately 12'x12' SF.
